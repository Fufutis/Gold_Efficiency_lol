Gold_Efficiency is a website that will convert all the stats into gold to create a system where you can predict the outcome of a fight if both of the teams were on an even skill level.

the end goal is to get all the stats and then do a calculation to see the general value of a 1 on 1 or true value. 1 on 1 value is considering your hp to their dmg so if you could output all of your potential before you die. true vale is when you are being defended (ad carry usually) and which build path could get you the biggest advantage. using this most probably could help riot improve the reccomended system, since it only follows popular builds and its not viable when item changes happen

To use it (currently im testing the values so u can see by adding custom stats)

then by adding a league of legends champion(Capitals are needed for champions and items) 
Example Veigar , Blade of the ruined king

and it will show you every possible stat u can get from api

my job here is to work with it (manually add the %s and damage values) and from there i can complete the calculations its still in its early stages >:( 

bellow is my to do list or to look out for so yeah its still early im learning as im going so yeah bye byee

to find and connect items - https://darkintaqt.com/blog/item-ids

Ideas Total stats would give stat checker points as level 1
then total stats with abilities
total stas with abilities and runes

estimate of damaga for a full combo for each champion to create a good burst hp/resistance range

currently the description doesnt mention the % dmg it just says deals on hit dmg which is an issue 

Reached conclition that i have to do it manually 
i guess for all items ill manually add the descriptions its just like what 100 items its okay :'D
